# Linked List:
- Data structure to hold data of any type and size
  # Advantages:
  - Insertion in O(1) <-- Good implementations will always keep the pointer to the last node. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1933085/linked-list-insertion-running-time-confusion
  
  
  
# Concepts:
- Constant Time:
"Constant time" has the same meaning as "O(1)", which doesn't mean that an algorithm runs in a fixed amount of time,
it just means that it isn't proportional to the length/size/magnitude of the input. i.e., for any input, it can be computed 
in the same amount of time (even if that amount of time is really long).
