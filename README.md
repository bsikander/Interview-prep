# Linked List:
- Data structure to hold data of any type and size
  **Advantages:**
  - Insertion in O(1). 
  > Insertion consists of two functions Find + insert. Insert is always O(1) but find always makes the difference. If we have the pointer then find is O(1) otherwise find will be O(n) which makes the overall time of insert to be O(n). <-- [Good implementations will  always keep the pointer to the last node](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1933085/linked-list-insertion-running-time-confusion)
  - Access is O(n)
  
  **Disadvantages**
  - Memory waste for extra pointers
  
  
  
# Concepts:
- **Constant Time**:
"Constant time" has the same meaning as "O(1)", which doesn't mean that an algorithm runs in a fixed amount of time,
it just means that it isn't proportional to the length/size/magnitude of the input. i.e., for any input, it can be computed 
in the same amount of time (even if that amount of time is really long).
